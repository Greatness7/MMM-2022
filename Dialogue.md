        - Low Disposition, doesn't meet requirements:
            "That's none of your business."
        - Doesn't meet the requirements:
            "I appreciate your concern, but I don't think I should discuss this matter with a simple #PCRank."
        - Meets Rank requirements but not reputation requirements:
            "Firemoth is, or should I say used to be, an Imperial fort off the shore to the west. It was captured years ago by a lich named Grurn and his army of undead. As far as I know, there were no survivors. We've been trying to recapture it ever since to no avail. I'm looking for a worthy commander to lead the next raid. If you know anyone, please let me know."

                    PC refuses:
                        "Not the answer I was hoping for. I guess I'll have to find someone else then. Let me know if you change your mind."
                    PC agrees:
                        "Excellent. Head out back to the dock, you'll meet your crew there. Talk to the boat captain about the trip to Firemoth. May the Nine be with you."
