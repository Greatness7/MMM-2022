### rumors

> It’s said that newly arrived recruits for the Imperial garrisons whisper about a horde of the dead rising from the water and over-running an abandoned fort somewhere in the Inner Sea. I imagine the Legion captain in Seyda Neen can tell you more.

> I heard the Imperial Legion lost a battalion on Fort Firemoth. The captain in Seyda Neen is rallying reinforcements for another attempt. Poor souls.

> Did you hear, trading ships spotted green mist along the coast of the abandoned Fort Firemoth islet. I wonder if the Imperial Legion know anything about it.

## Dialogue

### Aronil

#### Before Accepting

> Go away. I'm much too busy for the likes of you.

> I said go away.

#### After Accepting

> You're the one Gravius put in charge of this charade? Who are you to be giving me orders? Though I imagine you taking the blame for any failings is a better option. Very well, lead the way.

> Must you?

#### Arriving on Island

> The air here is befouled with the stench of dark magics. We should exercise caution, as I cannot and will not protect you all.

> Now is not the time!

#### Regroup

> You're still alive? I'm surprised but relieved.

> Are you ready?

#### Corpse Found

> Hjrondir. The poor Nord.

#### Defeat

> You've done better than I was expecting, well done. Best head back to Sellus Gravius, we'll clean up here.

### Hjrondir

#### Before Accepting

> What do you want? Can I help you?

> Hmm?

#### After Accepting

> Ah! So you're the fool Sellus Gravius found to lead this charge? Good, find me a skull for my axe before I bury it in this fool milk-drinker’s head!

> Lead the way! We're here to kill!

#### Arriving on Island

> It’ll take more than chattering bones to chill this Nord’s blood. Are you with me, %PCName?

> Can we talk later? There's more urgent matters at hand!

#### Regroup

> By Shor's bones, you survived! Let's get going while we can.

> You have my axe.

#### Defeat

> You did good. Drinks're on you.

### Mara

#### Before Accepting

> [Mara gives you a look of disgust, saying nothing.]

> [Mara won't even look at you.]

#### After Accepting

> Well, well, well. Our motley crew finally finds a motley chief. You seem competent enough, we’ll soon find out, won’t we?

> Shall we press on?

#### Arriving on Island

> There’s so many of them, just like the last time. This will be like shooting hagfish in a barrel. I just hope I brought enough arrows, I admit.

> [Mara has a bloodlust in her eyes.]

#### Regroup

> I must admit I'm glad to see you. Let's end this.

> [Mara looks determined.]

#### Corpse Found

> Is that Hjrondir? We should be careful.

#### Defeat

> It's over. It's finally over. I can't thank you enough, can you report back? We have some things to take care of here.

#### last time

> I was there before, this task should not be undertaken likely. A horde of skeletons protect the island along with an everlasting thunderstorm making crossing the water near-impossible.

#### crossing the water

> There was a short crossing where the strikes were less frequent, likely thanks to destroyed ships piling up in the area.

#### Fighting Skeletons Too Long

> What are you helping us for? Get to the fort, and stay out of the water!

### Gravius

#### Return with Shield

> You've returned in one piece, impressive. I can't thank you enough for what you've done, the Empire thanks you. You can keep the [WARD], you've earned it. And here's some gold for your troubles.

#### Return without Shield

> You've returned in one piece, impressive. I can't thank you enough for what you've done, the Empire thanks you. And here's some gold for your troubles.
