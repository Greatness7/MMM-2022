## Introduction

### Overview

> *The island fortress of Firemoth was taken by the skeleton army of Grurn years ago. It's time to take it back. Sellus Gravius, Captain of the Seyda Neen Census and Excise Office, hires you to lead a band of adventurers to the Fort.*

The mod is an overhaul and expansion of the [Siege at Firemoth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Siege_at_Firemoth) plugin.

## Story

### Characters

#### Grurn

The leader of the undead horde that has overrun Fort Firemoth. Grurn is an ancient lich necromancer. He carries the *Ward of Akavir* artifact and specializes in lightning magic. 

In his life he was the [Imperial Battlemage](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Battlemages#Imperial_Battlemage_of_Tamriel) for [Uriel Septim V](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_V). He accompanied the emperor on the failed [invasion of Akavir in 3E 290](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Report:_Disaster_at_Ionith), acquiring the *Ward of Akavir* artifact in the process. 

After the death of Uriel V in Akavir the imperial armies fled by boat back to Tamriel. During the return trip Grurn became their scapegoat and was eventually betrayed and thrown overboard into the sea. Through unknown means Grurn managed to preserve his body by completing the transformation into a lich. The ordeal left his magic spent and he entered a long slumber to recover. 

Approximately a hundred years later, Grurn awoke and began his long sea walk back to Tamriel. His magics replenished and enhanced by lichdom, he is more formidable than ever. A perpetual lightning storm fills the skies above him. He raises a skeleton horde as a goes; animating the remains of what was once the imperial navy. 

Driven by revenge he makes his way to Fort Firemoth, where the imperials had kept the *Ward of Akavir* artifact, unaware of it's history. The undead horde walk out of the sea and overrun the fort. He reclaims the *Ward of Akavir* and makes the fort into his citadel. Further attempts by the empire to reclaim the fort have repeatedly met with failure.

#### Sellus Gravius

> *This Imperial fort offshore to the west was captured years ago by the undead horde of Grurn, who literally marched out of the ocean and overran the garrison there. The survivors were forced to leave behind the Ward of Akavir, and I'm looking for someone to lead a group to retrieve it. Are you up for it?*

Imperial Legion officer who is recruiting a band of adventurers to reclaim Fort Firemoth.

#### Silm-Dar

> *Are you ready to sail to Firemoth Fort?*

Argonian Sailor. Provides travel to/from the Firemoth island and Seyda Neen.

#### Aronil

> *I'll follow you. I hope you know what you're doing.*

Altmer battlemage who joins you on the expedition. High level, doubts your competency.

#### Hjrondir

> *Lead the way! We're here to kill!*

A nord warrior who joins you on the expedition. Loyal, battle hungry.

#### Mara

> *I've seen worse. Lead On.*

Bosmer archer who joins you on the expedition. Cocky, bored?

#### JHanir

> *Thank you for finding me! The mushrooms have kept me alive for some time now. Lead the way, and I'll help anyway I can.*

Argonion archer. Sole living survivor of the original fort staff. Survived by hiding in the mines and living off mushrooms.

## Quest

Below is a rough bare-bones outline of the quest stages, and random related ideas/thoughts.

* If the player is of sufficient rank/reputation they will hear rumors of Sellus Gravius recruiting adventurers.
    * Requires rank Champion (4) and 10 reputation? (They won't give this quest to a random newcomer who hasn't proved himself)
* The player speaks with Sellus Gravius, learns about Fort Firemoth, and agrees to join the expedition.
    * Doesn't need to be a huge lore dump. We can learn the backstory details from spirits or quests in the second stage.
* The player meets up with the other members of the expedition (Aronil, Hjrondir, Mara) at the docks and they all take the boat to Firemoth Island.
    * We could insert some more backstory for these guys if anyone is interested. Perhaps the player himself recruits them?
* The band arrives at Firemoth island and make their way to the keep.
    * The island (and interior) is enhanced with custom visuals, assets, and ambient music/sounds.
    * Most likely will include a few cinematic combat sequences. Skeletons rising from the ground/etc.
    * Managing companion AI sucks so we should come up with good reasons for the group to split up.
    * Possibly some kind of curse mechanic is engaged upon stepping onto the land.
    * Lightning strikes that do damage to living and reanimate undead.
    * Collect as many ideas as we can and implement the best ones!
* The player makes his way through the fort dungeon and its lower levels.
    * Mixture of 3 tilesets (Imperial, Cavern, and Velothi).
    * Loads of room for fun puzzles and encounters. 
    * Illusionary infinite hallways, nonsensical geometry, whatever.
    * Collect as many ideas as we can and implement the best ones!
* In the lowest depths the player encounters Grurn and defeats him.
    * Maybe cinematic boss battle, or maybe somethign more exploation related. Many options.
* The player returns to Sellus Gravius with the Ward of Akavir as proof of success.
    * Unlike the vanilla implementation, player gets to keep the artifact.

## Visuals

* There is a persistent storm due to Grurns presence.
