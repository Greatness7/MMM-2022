## Introduction

### Overview

> *The island fortress of Firemoth was taken by the skeleton army of Grurn years ago. It's time to take it back. Sellus Gravius, Captain of the Seyda Neen Census and Excise Office, hires you to lead a band of adventurers to the Fort.*

The mod is an overhaul and expansion of the [Siege at Firemoth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Siege_at_Firemoth) plugin.

It will consist of mainly two stages:

1. An initial dungeon crawl, where the player is tasked with reclaiming the fort from the empire's enemies.
2. A series of follow-up quests and activities that allow the player to assist in restoring the ruined fort.

## Story

### Characters

#### Grurn

The leader of the undead horde that has overrun Fort Firemoth. Grurn is an ancient lich necromancer. He carries the *Ward of Akavir* artifact and specializes in lightning magic. 

In his life he was the [Imperial Battlemage](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Battlemages#Imperial_Battlemage_of_Tamriel) for [Uriel Septim V](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_V). He accompanied the emperor on the failed [invasion of Akavir in 3E 290](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Report:_Disaster_at_Ionith), acquiring the *Ward of Akavir* artifact in the process. 

After the death of Uriel V in Akavir the imperial armies fled by boat back to Tamriel. During the return trip Grurn became their scapegoat and was eventually betrayed and thrown overboard into the sea. Through unknown means Grurn managed to preserve his body by completing the transformation into a lich. The ordeal left his magic spent and he entered a long slumber to recover. 

Approximately a hundred years later, Grurn awoke and began his long sea walk back to Tamriel. His magics replenished and enhanced by lichdom, he is more formidable than ever. A perpetual lightning storm fills the skies above him. He raises a skeleton horde as a goes; animating the remains of what was once the imperial navy. 

Driven by revenge he makes his way to Fort Firemoth, where the imperials had kept the *Ward of Akavir* artifact, unaware of it's history. The undead horde walk out of the sea and overrun the fort. He reclaims the *Ward of Akavir* and makes the fort into his citadel. Further attempts by the empire to reclaim the fort have repeatedly met with failure.

#### Sellus Gravius

> *This Imperial fort offshore to the west was captured years ago by the undead horde of Grurn, who literally marched out of the ocean and overran the garrison there. The survivors were forced to leave behind the Ward of Akavir, and I'm looking for someone to lead a group to retrieve it. Are you up for it?*

Imperial Legion officer who is recruiting a band of adventurers to reclaim Fort Firemoth.

#### Silm-Dar

> *Are you ready to sail to Firemoth Fort?*

Argonian Sailor. Provides travel to/from the Firemoth island and Seyda Neen.

#### Aronil

> *I'll follow you. I hope you know what you're doing.*

Altmer battlemage who joins you on the expedition. High level, doubts your competency.

<details>
(Put any character ideas/details in here.)

A very powerful mage from the Summerset Isles. Wears a robe and some magic scrolls/items and a unique enchanted staff. Specialized in destruction and illusion magic. Will later die when attempting to open the seal (with a special scroll he carries with him) protecting the velothi tomb that Grurn resides in, if not previously killed.
</details>

#### Hjrondir

> *Lead the way! We're here to kill!*

A nord warrior who joins you on the expedition. Loyal, battle hungry.

#### Mara

> *I've seen worse. Lead On.*

Bosmer archer who joins you on the expedition. Cocky, bored?

An imperial lower ranking member of the Imperial Legion sent to help reclaim Fort Firemoth. As a former Imperial Cult priestess she is specialized in healing and holy (Turn Undead) magic. Wears regular heavy imperial legion armor with a shield and mace. Can become a companion/underling if she survives the entire quest chain and you return to Sellus Gravius.
</details>

#### JHanir

> *Thank you for finding me! The mushrooms have kept me alive for some time now. Lead the way, and I'll help anyway I can.*

Argonion archer. Sole living survivor of the original fort staff. Survived by hiding in the mines and living off mushrooms.

#### Lexion Pontius

A member of the EEC tasked with the rebuild and management of Fort Firemoth along with the player. Can be found inside the rebuilt Fort. Acts as a host for the Fort Management gameplay section.

## Quest

Below is a rough bare-bones outline of the quest stages, and random related ideas/thoughts.

* If the player is of sufficient rank/reputation they will hear rumors of Sellus Gravius recruiting adventurers.
    * Requires rank Champion (4) and 10 reputation? (They won't give this quest to a random newcomer who hasn't proved himself)
* The player speaks with Sellus Gravius, learns about Fort Firemoth, and agrees to join the expedition.
    * Doesn't need to be a huge lore dump. We can learn the backstory details from spirits or quests in the second stage.
* The player meets up with the other members of the expedition (Aronil, Hjrondir, Mara) at the docks and they all take the boat to Firemoth Island.
    * We could insert some more backstory for these guys if anyone is interested. Perhaps the player himself recruits them?
* The band arrives at Firemoth island and make their way to the keep.
    * The island (and interior) is enhanced with custom visuals, assets, and ambient music/sounds.
    * Most likely will include a few cinematic combat sequences. Skeletons rising from the ground/etc.
    * Managing companion AI sucks so we should come up with good reasons for the group to split up.
    * Possibly some kind of curse mechanic is engaged upon stepping onto the land.
    * Lightning strikes that do damage to living and reanimate undead.
    * Collect as many ideas as we can and implement the best ones!
* The player makes his way through the fort dungeon and its lower levels.
    * Mixture of 3 tilesets (Imperial, Cavern, and Velothi).
    * Loads of room for fun puzzles and encounters. 
    * Illusionary infinite hallways, nonsensical geometry, whatever.
    * Collect as many ideas as we can and implement the best ones!
* In the lowest depths the player encounters Grurn and defeats him.
    * Maybe cinematic boss battle, or maybe somethign more exploation related. Many options.
* The player returns to Sellus Gravius with the Ward of Akavir as proof of success.
    * Unlike the vanilla implementation, player gets to keep the artifact.
* New quest line opens up to begin the process of rebuilding Fort Firemoth.
    * Assets will be periodically swapped with repaired versions.
    * New staff can be recruited to populate the fort. Potentially some freed slaves.
    * Re-establish connections with the EEC to handle ebony trade.
    * Rebuild the docks to allow new fast travel locations.
    * Collect as many ideas as we can and implement the best ones!

<details>
(Text from Sephumbra's previous edit)

After teaming up with the rest of the party the player takes a boat to head to the island, where they will proceed to retake the island before heading into the ebony mines of the fort.
Upon reaching the entrance of the velothi tomb at the end of the mines Aronil will attempt to unlock the seal protecting the entrance with a special scroll he has prepared beforehand.
Upon using it the seal will be broken, Aronil dies and all remaining members will be afflicted by a curse.
If Aronil dies beforehand the player is required to break the seal with the scroll found on his body instead.
The player will not die doing this, but still get afflicted by the curse.

Once entering the velothi tomb the difficulty will increase a lot, so the player might not be able to get rid of the curse by killing Grurn immediately and needs to deal with its effects.
Throughout it the player is tasked with solving multiple puzzles or illusions in order to advance.
A shade of Grurn (Strongly weakened version of Grurn) will randomly spawn throughout the dungeon and attack the party.
The player can decide to never engage this threat without failing the quest.
In one room Hyrondir will talk to the player, babbling paranoid nonsense and going insane. He will then attack the player and Mara Varius.
A later room will have the player fight an illusionary copy of Mara Varius.
The player is not aware of this and will only realize this after the room has left and Mara is still with them.
Talking to her will reveal that she had no idea what is going on and will be concerned about you going insane too.

Upon reaching the final room where Grurn resides the party is forced to fight.
The player must find the phylactery (Stated in an optional note found in the ebony mine from a previous team sent to purge the undead) before being able to damage Grurn.
The Ward of Akavir can be found within the room (?).
Killing him will free the player and Mara Varius (If alive) of the curse and they can return to Sellus Gravius to complete the quest.

Upon completing the quest Sellus Gravius places Mara Varius (If alive) under your command, making her a permanent companion.
If the player has the rank of Knight Protector (7) within the legion Sellus Gravius will have an additional reward available: Rebuilding and managing Fort Firemoth and its ebony mine.

Rebuilding the fort to its basic form will only consist of being informed that they cooperated with the EEC to shore up reconstruction costs and waiting a week (?).
Once rebuilt the quest can be completed by talking to Sellus Gravius once more, referring you to Lexion Pontius inside the rebuilt Fort. The legion can't expend any more forces to protect the Fort so its up to the player to hire Mercenaries to do this.
The player is now free to manage the fort and the ebony mine with the help of the EEC on the island as stated under the corresponding gameplay section.
